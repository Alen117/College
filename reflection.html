                Responsive Web design is a concept that argues that design and development should adapt to the person â€™s needs and environment, taking into account screen size, platform, and orientation.

                Flexible grids and layouts, pictures, and judicious use of CSS media queries are all part of the process.
                When a user transitions from a laptop to an iPad, the website should adapt to the new device's resolution, picture size, and scripting capabilities.
                The user's device settings may also need to be considered; for example, if the user has a VPN for iOS on their iPad, the website should not limit the user's access to the page.
                In other words, the website should be equipped with technology that allows it to respond to the user's choices automatically.
                This would eliminate the need for each new item on the market to go through a separate design and development phase.

                Website designs and orientation vary with devices. One website perfect for a device may look good enough, or even worse when viewed on a different aspect-ratio , resolution etc. So,
                the concept of Responsive Web Design has a high priority in web development. We might need to rearrange the layout of the website to make the viewer comfortable with navigating
                through the site on all screen configurations. BootStrap is a popular free framework, which supports development for mobile devices.

                On the earth, there are 6.8 billion people, 5.1 billion of whom own a cell phone.
                Smartphones account for an ever-increasing portion of these devices.
                According to a recent Pew Research Center study, the number of people who use their smartphones to access the Internet has more than doubled in the last five years,
                as has the number of people who download and use mobile apps.
                More than a third of individuals who use the Internet or email on their phones do so primarily through their mobile devices.
                It is very unpleasant to even think of situations where a software on a laptop looks weirdly oriented and disfigured on a smart-phone.
                So, it is crucial that all users have the perfect experience, no matter what platform they are on. User-Interface has the same impact on users like the functionality of the
                website has. This is why Web-Development is an important aspect of IT industry.

                This course had me enlightened on the various aspects of Web Development. Frontend is just as important as the Backend is. The theories, examples, lectures and narration in the course were in such excellent detail that ,
                it was informative and fun to learn at the same time.
                I am looking forward to learn more on the Web-Development field to expand my knowledge and experience on this topic!
